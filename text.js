Make sure to enter your last name first and your first name second. The canon name in the anime and video games is Yu Narukami, and the canon name for the manga is Souji Seta.
@Afternoon
$Responses
You frequently will be able to respond to a character by choosing a response to give. Normally during the story these responses don't matter. There are some exceptions, and I will be sure to take note of them.
$Exploration
You are given a chance to look around the immediate area next to the gas station. While there isn't anything important to do, you can find some characters you will see later in the game. IMPORTANT!!!: There is also a blue butterfly to save your game. Make sure to save often! (WAQ1: Why do I need to save frequently?)
@Evening
$Fridge
If you check the fridge, you will find some Fried Rice. Feel free to eat it, but nothing will happen. There will be a new food item in the fridge every Monday. Some food items will greatly increase your Courage. which is a Status Parameter. IMPORTANT!!!: If I don't mention a food item on Monday, don't look in the fridge! Sometimes we will save the food for a different day, because it may take time. So be mindful of when to check the fridge!
$Futon
Here you can sleep to pass time. If you sleep in the futon any day but today, you will dream about a Social Link and earn bonus points toward it. However, we will never be making use of this. The futon gets no love from us.

$Daidara Metalworks
Yosuke gives you 5000 yen. Save all of it and don't buy anything. Money is a scarce resource in the early game, and plentiful late game. Right now any equipment you buy have minimal increases in stats, and there are ways to get good equipment without buying it.
$Vending Machine
In the Shopping District North, you can buy soda from the vending machines. TaP Soda costs 120 yen, and it restores 10 SP, which is hard to come by. You can buy 5 a week, and it restocks on Monday. I would recommend investing in these, especially if you find yourself having trouble with saving SP. Unfortunately, they are sold out today.
TV World
Obtained 3 Revival Beads, 5 Peach Seeds, and 5 Soul Drops
IMPORTANT!!!: A quest later in the game requires a Peach Seed. Keep one on hand to fulfill this quest.
$Shuffle Time
Shuffle Time is one of 2 ways to obtain Personas. Shuffle Time is obtained by exploiting enemy weaknesses, using All-Out Attacks, and finishing the battle quickly. If there are no Personas to collect, your priority should be something close to this: Sweep Bonus, Magician, Temperance, Hermit, Emperor. Getting a Sweep Bonus guarantees Shuffle Time next battle, gives you 3 picks instead of one, and gets rid of cards with negative effects.
$Required Personas
IMPORTANT!!!: Before the boss, you should make sure you have a Magician and a Strength Persona, or have a way to fuse them. It can be hard to get a Strength Persona, so I would be at Lv 5 to fuse it. (WAQ3: Why do I need specific Personas?)

It is unknown if accepting earns you bonus points, but my testing suggests that it doesn't.
